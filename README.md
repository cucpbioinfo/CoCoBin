# CoCoBin: Graph-Based Metagenomic Binning via Compositionâ€“Coverage Separation
The CoCoBin is a multi-stage binning method designed to enhance metagenomic analysis. It proceeds through the following stages: (1) assembling reads into contigs, (2) extracting compositional features, (3) computing contig similarity, (4) structuring complex networks, and (5) clustering. This study primarily focuses on the contig similarity computation stage, a critical component of the binning process. Contigs are initially grouped based on their length ranges. Similarity between contigs is then calculated using a combination of compositional similarity and coverage difference. This hybrid similarity metric, when integrated with the Louvain clustering algorithm, demonstrates strong performance in terms of the number of bins identified.
