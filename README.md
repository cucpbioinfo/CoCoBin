# CoCoBin: Graph-Based Metagenomic Binning via Compositionâ€“Coverage Separation
The CoCoBin is a multi-stage binning method designed to enhance metagenomic analysis. It proceeds through the following stages: (1) assembling reads into contigs, (2) extracting compositional features, (3) computing contig similarity, (4) structuring complex networks, and (5) clustering. This study primarily focuses on the contig similarity computation stage, a critical component of the binning process. Contigs are initially grouped based on their length ranges. Similarity between contigs is then calculated using a combination of compositional similarity and coverage difference. This hybrid similarity metric, when integrated with the Louvain clustering algorithm, demonstrates strong performance in terms of the number of bins identified.
# Installation
1. First clone the CoCoBin repository to a local directory. Note that CoCoBin only supports linux.
```
git clone https://github.com/cucpbioinfo/CoCoBin.git
cd Metagenomic-Binning/Binning_project/
pip install .
```
2. Then run following command to run the tool.
```
binning-run contigs.fasta 4Mer_Composition
```
